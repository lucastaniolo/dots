## Code test description:

Create Dots “Classic” using the Unity3d Engine. Make sure to reference the game for any questions regarding specific gameplay mechanics / orientation / etc.

Game features for the project:

>Populate the board with dots.

>Connect like colored dots.

>Disconnection of dots.

>Replenish the board with dots.

>The Square Mechanic: When a square is created, all like colored dots are removed from the board.

>Dots dropping animation.

_No user interfaces need to be present, nor do you need to implement any mechanics ( e.g. score, time, moves, etc ). The
end result should be the Dots game that plays without scores, ad infinitum_
